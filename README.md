# Twitter Clone Made using Django
Django project replicating various functions of Twitter.
Users can create an account, log in and out, edit their profile, retweet, like, save and comment on other tweets, create and delete tweets, and follow/unfollow other users.
This is a personal project to help me get familiar with Django.

## How to Run the Project
1.  Clone repository by entering the following into your command line: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannyjimenez98/Social_Media_App.git
```
2. 
```bash
cd Social_Media_App
```
